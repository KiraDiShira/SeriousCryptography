**Encryption** is the principal application of **cryptography**; it makes data incomprehensible in order to ensure its **confidentiality**. Encryption uses an algorithm called a **cipher** and a secret value called the **key**; if you don’t know the secret key, you can’t decrypt, nor can you learn any bit of information on the encrypted message—and neither can any attacker.

In **symmetric encryption**, the key used to decrypt is the same as the key used to encrypt (unlike **asymmetric encryption**, or **public-key encryption**, in which the key used to decrypt is different from the key used to encrypt).

When we’re encrypting a message, **plaintext** refers to the unencrypted message and **ciphertext** to the encrypted message.
